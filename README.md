# Mergers & Acquisitions Integration Accelerator (MAIA)

This repository includes sample projects representing components of a solution to streamline Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) integration. M&A often involves migrating or moving AWS accounts in to an existing organization. 
Typically, during the M&A Integration phase, time is wasted due to inefficient communication and application of control objectives and technical requirements, as well as inaccurate and stale risk and compliance assessments.
